The fort was constructed between 1664 and 1667 under the orders of Chhatrapati Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha Empire. The main objective of building the fort was to counter the rising influence of European merchants in the Konkan coast and to curb the rise of the Siddhis of Janjira The fort is built on a small island known as the Khurte island and is spread over 48 acres, with a two-mile (3 km) long rampart, and walls that are 30 feet (9.1 m) high and 12 feet (3.7 m) thick. The massive walls were designed to serve as a deterrent to approaching enemies and to the waves and tides of the Arabian Sea. The main entrance to the fort is concealed in such a way that it cannot be pinpointed from outside.",
